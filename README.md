# mockbot
A Discord bot to mock your friends.

This is the source code for a JavaScript-based Discord bot that mocks the last thing someone said when summoned with the !mock followed by the @username command.

Mockbot takes the last message the target user sent and converts it into alternating upper case and lower case letters, in a mocking fashion. It then sends that message to the Discord chat for everyone to laugh at.

Mockbot comes with a few other commands like !larry and !trash to further mock users in your chats.

Mockbot runs on Node.js and Discord.js, so you will need to install those.

The index.js file is the main code, and the .json files are Node.js modules.
